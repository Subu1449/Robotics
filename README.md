Robotics
========

A series of programs created for the NXT Brick and Autonomous Program for our Robot, Diglett.
Our group consisted of three individuals: Quinn, Dylan, and myself. The programming was done in RobotC language. 
This was Quinn and my first year with programming with robots so the scripts are funamental.
